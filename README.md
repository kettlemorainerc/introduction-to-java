An example introduction to java and it's pieces.

You can look inside the [app module's sources](app/src/main/java/org/usfirst/team2077/intro/App.java)
for pieces that may help you create tic-tac-toe. It is most likely not EVERYTHING you'll need to learn.

It should introduce you to some concepts that either more advanced, or more java-centered than other
languages.

You can attempt to create your own version of tic-tac-toe, such as the [tic-tac-toe jar file](tic-tac-toe.jar)
provided as an example.

`java -jar tic-tac-toe.jar` inside a terminal (cmd or powershell, for example) will allow you to play the example game.
Your editor may allow you right-click on the jar in the file explorer and `run` or `execute` the jar file from it.

You can run the application provided to you by running `./gradlew run` (or maybe `gradlew run`). To better match the
code provided to what it actually does. You may also the gradle menu in your editor. Look to right side of the editor
in IntelliJ.
